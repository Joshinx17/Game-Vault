# Game-Vault

A simple, browser-based vault and hub for playing a collection of classic and modern mini-games built purely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 🌟 About the Project

**Game-Vault** is a personal project intended to serve as a single, easily accessible platform for various web-based games. The goal is to provide a clean, fun, and responsive interface where users can quickly browse and launch games directly in their browser without any external dependencies or installations.

The entire project is built on the core trio of web development languages, making it a great resource for learning how to structure and implement simple game logic in **Vanilla JavaScript**.

## 🚀 Features

* **Central Game Hub:** A single `index.html` page to list all available games.
* **Pure Web Tech:** Games are implemented using only **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for play across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
* **Modular Code:** Game logic is separated into dedicated files (`games.js`, `script.js`) for easy expansion and maintenance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HTML5** | Structure and game display. |
| **CSS3** | Styling, layout, and visual design. |

## 📁 Project Structure

The repository is structured to separate core hub logic from individual game files:

├── .github/
│   └── workflows/  \# GitHub Actions for CI/CD or deployment
├── game.html       \# Template file for launching an individual game
├── games.js        \# JavaScript file containing data/config for all games
├── index.html      \# Main landing page (the Game Hub)
├── script.js       \# Core JavaScript logic for the game vault (e.g., navigation)
├── style.css       \# Global styles for the hub interface
└── README.md       \# This file
